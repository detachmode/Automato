Every programming language makes it easy to create console apps, but as soon as you want to create a crossplatform UI you need to learn and add a lot of dependencies to your app. If you only want to create a simple tool without the need for a highly customizable UI framework you usually won't bother doing that.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that enables developers to easily create SIMPLE user interfaces for their scripts / console apps that run everywhere. 

Instead of embedding a framework / dependencies in each and every app/script you write, your app is embedded in this tool.

This is inspired by programming environments like Pharao or scripting languages that run inside big applications.
